A geodesic dome framework is typically constructed using a series of interconnected triangular elements that form a spherical or partial-spherical structure. The framework relies on the principles of geodesics, which are the shortest paths between two points on a curved surface, to distribute stress evenly across the structure. Here's an overview of its structure:

### Key Components:
1. **Triangles**:
   - The primary building block of geodesic domes is the triangle. Triangles are inherently strong shapes that provide structural stability.

2. **Frequency**:
   - The dome's frequency determines the number of triangular subdivisions. A higher frequency results in a smoother and more spherical appearance but increases complexity.

3. **Vertices and Edges**:
   - The vertices and edges of the triangles form a network of nodes and struts. These struts are typically made from lightweight materials like aluminum, steel, or wood.

4. **Hubs**:
   - At the vertices, hubs (or nodes) connect multiple struts. These hubs are designed to handle the forces transmitted through the structure.

5. **Base**:
   - The dome is often supported by a circular base, which can be a foundation or a ring beam.

6. **Covering**:
   - The framework can be covered with materials like fabric, glass, or plastic to create an enclosed space.

### Construction Steps:
1. **Design**:
   - Use mathematical formulas or software to generate the geodesic dome's geometry. The geodesic frequency and radius are specified during this stage.

2. **Cutting and Preparing Materials**:
   - Struts are cut to the required lengths based on the dome's design. The lengths vary based on the type of geodesic division (e.g., 2V, 3V).

3. **Assembly**:
   - The struts are connected at the hubs to form triangles. These triangles are then assembled into hexagons and pentagons, forming the dome's spherical shape.

4. **Anchoring**:
   - The dome is anchored to its base to ensure stability.
