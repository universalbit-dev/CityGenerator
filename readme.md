### [CityGenerator](https://github.com/universalbit-dev/CityGenerator)

**Description**:  
The **CityGenerator** project focuses on creating dynamic city models inspired by the principles outlined in the [Fab City: The Mass Distribution of (Almost) Everything](https://fablabbcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fab-City-The-Mass-Distribution-of-Almost-Everything.pdf) white paper. It aims to provide tools for simulating and visualizing sustainable, self-sufficient, and resilient urban environments.

---

**Key Objectives**:
1. **Sustainability**: Promote local production and reduce dependency on external resources, aligning with the Fab City framework.
2. **Resilience**: Envision cities capable of adapting to environmental, social, and economic changes.
3. **Collaboration**: Create open-source tools and models to engage developers, urban planners, and researchers in building decentralized urban systems.

---

### Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/universalbit-dev/CityGenerator.git
cd CityGenerator
```
### Install packages with npm then generate your city model
```bash
npm i && npm audit fix
npm start
```
**Automated Certificate Generation**:
   - To simplify the process for users, the project is set up to automatically generate the SSL/TLS certificate and private key required for HTTPS during the npm install process. This eliminates the need for manual certificate creation, streamlining the setup of the HTTPS server.

**Fixing Issues**:
   - If you encounter any issues with the HTTPS server or certificate generation, refer to the [SSL README](ssl/readme.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.

* [TypeScript Note](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/)

#### Build your Project:
The `bundle.js` file is currently located in the `/src` directory, which is not ideal. Generated files like `bundle.js` should be placed in a separate directory like `/dist` to maintain a clean project structure. Additionally, the application encounters issues and gets stuck during runtime or build.
**[BlackScreen]**

```bash
npm run build
```
---

**[Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer)**


- `bundle.js` should be removed from `/src` and instead generated in `/dist`.
- The application should run smoothly after the change.

"In a project like CityGenerator, which seems to involve complex features (e.g., blockchain-driven urban designs), managing bundle size is critical for ensuring good performance, especially for web-based applications. Using webpack-bundle-analyzer can help identify and reduce inefficiencies in the build output"
