# CityGenerator Documentation

Welcome to the **CityGenerator** project! This repository is dedicated to creating futuristic cities using a blockchain approach. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the key components and technologies used in this project.

## Repository Overview
- **Project Description**: A futuristic city generator leveraging blockchain technologies.

## Application Overview

The core of the application is a web-based platform, with its main entry point located in the `dist/index.html` file. Below is a detailed breakdown of the file's structure and functionality:

### HTML Structure

- **Basic Structure**: The file includes standard HTML elements such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- **Metadata**:
  - Language: `lang="en"`
  - Character Encoding: `charset="utf-8"`
  - Page Title: "CityGenerator"

### JavaScript Imports

- **underscore.js**: Imported as a module from a CDN.
- **Import Map**: Configures imports for libraries such as:
  - `three` and `three/addons/` (3D rendering)
  - `jsts` (Geometry tools)
- **mnist.js**: Included from a CDN for machine learning tasks.

### Cookie Management

- **Cookie Removal Script**: Deletes all cookies for the domain and its subdomains using a self-invoking function.
- **Cookie Banner**: Displays a message to users about cookies, including a link for additional information.

### Machine Learning Features

#### Deep Q-Learning

- **Setup**:
  - Variables and neural network layers are defined for reinforcement learning.
  - Temporal difference learning is configured.
- **Implementation**: A `deepqlearn.Brain` instance is initialized for managing the learning process.

#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Setup**:
  - Layers for a CNN are defined using `convnetjs`.
  - A `convnetjs.Net` instance and a `convnetjs.Trainer` instance are initialized with specified options.

### Graphics Rendering

- **SVG and Canvas Elements**:
  - An SVG element with `id="map-svg"`.
  - Two canvas elements (`id="map-canvas"` and `id="img-canvas"`) with dimensions of 300x150 pixels each.
- **Additional Scripts**:
  - `digibyte.js`: For blockchain interactions.
  - `bundle.js`: Combines application-specific scripts.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implements neural networks for tasks such as deep Q-learning and CNN-based processing.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Utilizes `three.js` for 3D visualizations and rendering.
- **Cookie-Less Experience**: Includes mechanisms to reduce cookie usage while maintaining user experience.
