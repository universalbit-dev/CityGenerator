# Heightmap

To download a heightmap, click `Downlad -> Heightmap`. Alternatively, select the 'Heightmap' style from the Style folder, and download an image as usual.
The heightmap resolution is controlled relative to the canvas resolution by `imageScale`.

### Generate and download heightmap

| Heightmap | Map |

Click `Downlad -> Heightmap`.

?> **Tip** Higher heightmap resolution result in 'better' 3D models but they'll take longer to generate and render. I'm using an `imageScale` of 2 for this example.

### Create 3D model

I'm using Blender 2.79 for this example.
Follow [this tutorial](https://johnflower.org/tutorial/make-mountains-blender-heightmaps) to create the model. Some of my notes on the process are below.

- **Grid:** I created a grid with the same number of subdivisions as there are pixels in the depth map. I then scaled it so that it had the same aspect ratio as the depth map. For high-res depths maps this will run slowly, consider cropping the depth map/creating smaller geometry if you only want to render a specific portion of the city.
- **Displacement Modifier:** I use Strength: 0.1
- **Subsurface Modifier:** It's up to you whether or not to use this - it drastically affects performance if your plane has a lot of vertices. For my render, setting divisions to 2 took 9 minutes to compute before even starting rendering.
- **Camera:** I used an orthographic camera with aperture 8.0 to create the depth of field effect. I placed a cube in the scene and set that as the focus point for easier control over where the focus was. Make sure to hide the cube before rendering.
- **Lighting** For my example I used a sun lamp with strength 2.0

My render was done with imageScale 2, subsurf 2, and took 40 minutes on a Macbook pro.
