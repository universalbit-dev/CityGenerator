# STL Files

This folder contains `.stl` files generated by the CityGenerator project. These files represent 3D models of urban elements such as buildings, parks, roads, and natural features (e.g., rivers, coastlines). These `.stl` files are ideal for 3D printing or visualization purposes.

| File Name          | Description                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `blocks.stl`       | 3D model of modular urban blocks.            |
| `buildings.stl`    | Collection of building structures.           |
| `coastline.stl`    | Represents the coastline geometry.           |
| `domain.stl`       | Visualization of the project domain.         |
| `custom.stl`       | Custom urban design element.                 |
| `river.stl`        | 3D model of river networks.                  |
| `roads.stl`        | A detailed road network.                     |
| `sea.stl`          | Representation of sea or water bodies.       |

## How to Use

- Use an online STL viewer or software like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) to open `.stl` files.
- For 3D printing, load the `.stl` files into your slicer software to prepare them for printing.

## Future Additions

We plan to expand this gallery with more `.stl` files representing various urban and architectural elements. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
