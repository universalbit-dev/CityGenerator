## Documentation: `city.json`

### Overview
The `city.json` file is a structured data file that represents 3D objects and geometries, likely used for generating or rendering futuristic cities. It adheres to a schema that defines metadata, geometries, and attributes of 3D models.

---

### File Structure

#### 1. Metadata
The `metadata` section provides essential information about the file version, type, and generator.

- **Fields**:
  - `version` (number): Specifies the version of the schema used (e.g., `4.6`).
  - `type` (string): The type of data represented in the file (`"Object"`).
  - `generator` (string): Indicates the tool or method used to generate the file, such as `"Object3D.toJSON"`.

#### 2. Geometries
An array of geometric objects, each representing a 3D component of the city.

- **Fields**:
  - `uuid` (string): A unique identifier for the geometry.
  - `type` (string): Specifies the type of geometry, such as `"BufferGeometry"`.
  - `data` (object): Contains detailed attributes of the geometry.

#### 3. Data Attributes
Attributes describe the geometric properties of the 3D objects.

- **Fields**:
  - `position` (object): Represents the vertex positions in 3D space.
    - `itemSize` (number): Number of components per vertex attribute (e.g., 3 for X, Y, Z coordinates).
    - `type` (string): The data type, such as `"Float32Array"`.
    - `array` (array): A list of numerical values representing the 3D coordinates.

### Example Content
Below is a partial example of the `city.json` file:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": 4.6,
    "type": "Object",
    "generator": "Object3D.toJSON"
  },
  "geometries": [
    {
      "uuid": "dbf32e3f-b6b1-4c0e-8108-54c102dd4d54",
      "type": "BufferGeometry",
      "data": {
        "attributes": {
          "position": {
            "itemSize": 3,
            "type": "Float32Array",
            "array": [18.26163673400879, 0, -8.146533012390137, ...]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Usage
1. **Rendering 3D Objects**:
   - Use a 3D rendering engine like [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to load and render the geometries described in `city.json`.

2. **Editing or Extending**:
   - The file can be edited to add new geometries or modify existing ones.
   - Ensure changes adhere to the schema to maintain compatibility with rendering tools.

3. **Serialization**:
   - Use tools like `Object3D.toJSON` to serialize 3D objects into this format.
