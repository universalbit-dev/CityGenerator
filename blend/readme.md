### **Wavefront OBJ File Format Overview**
Wavefront OBJ files are plain-text files containing geometric data about 3D objects. They are widely used for transferring models between 3D design and rendering software.

### **Structure of `city.obj`**
The `city.obj` file from your repository contains the following key sections:

1. **File Header**
   - Example:
     ```
     # Blender 4.0.2
     # www.blender.org
     mtllib city.mtl
     o blocks
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `#` are comments, often providing metadata about the file, such as the software used to create the model (e.g., Blender 4.0.2).
     - `mtllib city.mtl` specifies an external material library (`city.mtl`) that defines how the surfaces of the 3D model will appear (e.g., color, texture, shininess).
     - `o blocks` indicates the name of the object being defined in this section.

2. **Vertex Data**
   - Example:
     ```
     v 18.261637 0.000000 -8.146533
     v 18.662390 0.000000 -8.648925
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `v` define vertices, which are points in 3D space.
     - Each vertex is defined by three numbers representing its X, Y, and Z coordinates.
     - In this case:
       - The first vertex is located at `(18.261637, 0.000000, -8.146533)`.
       - The second vertex is at `(18.662390, 0.000000, -8.648925)`.

3. **Vertex Normals (Optional)**
   - Example:
     ```
     vn 0.0 1.0 0.0
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `vn` define vertex normals, which are vectors perpendicular to the surface at a vertex.
     - These are used for lighting calculations in rendering.

4. **Texture Coordinates (Optional)**
   - Example:
     ```
     vt 0.5 0.5
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `vt` define texture coordinates, used to map a 2D texture onto the 3D surface.
     - Each texture coordinate is defined by two numbers representing the U and V axes.

5. **Face Definitions**
   - Example:
     ```
     f 1 2 3
     f 4 5 6
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `f` define faces, which are polygons that make up the surface of the object.
     - Each face is defined by a list of vertex indices (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`), referring to previously defined vertices.
     - In this example:
       - The first face is made up of vertices 1, 2, and 3.
       - The second face uses vertices 4, 5, and 6.

6. **Groups and Object Names**
   - Example:
     ```
     g group_name
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `g` indicate groupings of faces, allowing for logical segmentation of the model (e.g., separating different parts of a building).
     - Groups can be useful for applying different materials or transformations to specific parts of the model.

7. **Use of Materials**
   - Example:
     ```
     usemtl material_name
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - Lines starting with `usemtl` specify which material (from the material library) should be applied to subsequent faces.

### **Purpose of `city.obj`**
The purpose of this file is to define the geometry of a 3D object (likely a city layout or structure) for use in:
- **3D Rendering**:
  - The file can be imported into 3D rendering engines like Blender, Unity, or Unreal Engine to visualize and manipulate the model.
- **City Simulation**:
  - As part of the `CityGenerator` project, this file might represent blocks, buildings, or other structural elements of a city being generated or simulated.
- **Collaborative Design**:
  - OBJ files are commonly used for sharing 3D models between team members or across different software platforms.
