## CPU Mining
  
  Learn about multi-threaded CPU mining for DigiByte.

### How to Set Up CPU Mining
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   This project includes a multi-threaded CPU miner for DigiByte:  
   [CityGenerator Workers](https://github.com/universalbit-dev/CityGenerator/tree/master/workers)

2. **Alternative CPU Miners**  
   - [Download pre-built CPU miners from SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/files/)

3. **Build CPU Miner from Source**  
   Follow these steps to compile the miner from source:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev build-essential
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure CFLAGS="-O3" # Ensure -O3 is an uppercase "O"
   make
   ```

### Setup Folder Permissions
Before starting the worker script, set the necessary folder permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod 744 -R ~/CityGenerator/workers
```

### Start the CPU Mining Process with PM2
Use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) for process management:
```bash
cd ~/CityGenerator/workers
npm i
pm2 start workers.js
```
