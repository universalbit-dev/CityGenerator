## Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency
- [Gekko-M4 Globular Cluster](https://github.com/universalbit-dev/gekko-m4-globular-cluster)  
  A sustainable cryptocurrency model inspired by decentralized finance and ecological principles.
---
"One of the core ecological principles encourages the thoughtful repurposing of older or unused hardware. By using such hardware for CPU mining, you can contribute to maintaining network node functionality and validating hashes effectively, all while helping to reduce electronic waste in a sustainable way."

### **CPU Mining Guide**

Learn about multi-threaded CPU mining for DigiByte and how to set up, build, and run a CPU miner effectively. This guide also introduces how to integrate CPU mining with blockchain environments like Gekko M4 Globular Cluster for innovative solutions.

---

#### **How to Set Up CPU Mining**

##### **1. Clone the Repository**
This project includes a **multi-threaded CPU miner** for DigiByte, located in the `CityGenerator Workers` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/universalbit-dev/CityGenerator.git
cd CityGenerator/workers
```

##### **2. Alternative CPU Miners**
- You can download pre-built CPU miners from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/).

---

#### **Build CPU Miner from Source** *(Optional)*

If you prefer to compile the miner from the source code, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev build-essential
./autogen.sh
./configure CFLAGS="-O3"  # Ensure -O3 is an uppercase "O"
make
```

---

#### **Setup Folder Permissions**

Before starting the worker script, ensure the necessary folder permissions are set:

```bash
sudo chmod 744 -R ~/CityGenerator/workers
```

---

#### **Start the CPU Mining Process with PM2**

The `worker.js` script is designed to:
1. Generate a random Digibyte address.
2. Initiate a CPU mining operation using **PM2** for process management.

Steps to start the mining process:

```bash
cd ~/CityGenerator/workers
npm install
pm2 start workers.js
```

---

#### **Integrate with Gekko M4 Globular Cluster**
* **[Repository](https://github.com/universalbit-dev/gekko-m4-globular-cluster)**
  
For advanced users, combine the mining process with **Gekko M4 Globular Cluster** in a blockchain environment. This integration unlocks innovative possibilities and helps create groundbreaking applications. Continue exploring ways to leverage blockchain technology for amazing results.
